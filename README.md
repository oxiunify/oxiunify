# 2023 Update - Don't use
Do not use this repository - haven't gotten around to yanking it yet. Async await with its function coloring is an acceptable tradeoff in order to remain compatible with C stack size expectations and in particular to smoothly talk to the GPU. As such, there is nothing much I can add. Look to existing ways of approaching asynchronous computation in C# AOT, Rust, C++, or Zig, not Go or Java. Thank you to everyone in the Rust community for so many helpful discussions for so many years. Have a great day.
